# Send1t

This is my Senior Capstone at Grand Canyon University. The purpose of this project is to make a mobile application that satisfies the basic needs of a modern communication platform. This means that it will require a user to send instant messages with other users one-on-one in real-time, as well as be able to send a message to a group of people at the same time. This Repo is the API. 

The Front-End can be found here: https://github.com/MrDuise/Send1t-Client



## Installation

To install this project insure that you have Node and NPM installed. You will also need an android or Iphone emulator to get this run
1. fork the main branch, then clone the repo
2. ```npm install``` to download the dependinces 
3. ```npm run start``` to start it up

This will get it running on your localhost, allowing access through Postman or some other API testing tool.
